# Journal For my Midterm Project
## Preliminary Description - 06/08/2021
I plan to make an adapter version of the chicken invaders game. The game would feature the protagonist a space-ship flying through space in a time where space is overtaken by chickens. Armed with an infinite number of bullets, it is the protagonist's job to shoot all the chickens and bring order to the universe.

I decided to include a leaderboard to the overall design of the game and also make the chickens lay eggs to make the game more fun. I also want to include the parallax effect into the game. I have all the images I need for the sprites, background and eggs.
