## Preliminary Description - 06/08/2021
I plan to make an adapter version of the chicken invaders game. The game would feature the protagonist a space-ship flying through space in a time where space is  
overtaken by chickens. Armed with an infinite number of bullets, it is the protagonist's job to shoot all the chickens and bring order to the universe.
