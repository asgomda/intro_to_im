# SELF POTRAIT MADE IN PROCESSING

## Below is how the potrait looks like

The main challenges I faced were getting the dimensions and placements of the shapes right, which a little arithmetic was able to solve. 

Also, when drawing a half circle using an arc in processing, I noticed that starting the angle at 0 and ending at radians(180) drew the bottom semi-circle, however starting at radians(180) and ending at 0 did not draw the top semi-cirlce. Hence to draw the top semi-circle, you need to start at radians(180) or PI and end at radians(360) or TWO_PI.
