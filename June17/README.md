## Arduino Analog Control
This is a simple analog control of LEDs using both a photoresistor and a switch. Pushing the switch increases the brightness of the blue LED and covering the photoresistor also increases the brightness of the Red Led and removing the covering resets the brightness to zero.

### Conclusion
The most difficult part of this project was figuring out the values to increase the LEDs by to make is obvious that the brightness was actually increasing, but after trying out different values, I was able to get the obvious change I desired.
