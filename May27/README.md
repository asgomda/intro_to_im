# Random Lines Visualizer 

This visualizer was inspired partly by computer art magazines and also by my desire to find out just how random the random() function is. I tried to see if patterns could emerge from the random function and if there ever will be a case where the two sets of lines are the same.

The program displays two sets of randomly generated lines side by side and the user can visualize just how random the function is, and would be able to tell if any patterns emerge.

## Below is interface of the program

What I discovered was that there is actually some _order_ in the random function and some patterns began to emerge. Some areas usually and consitently showed greater concentration in lines than other areas. This just goes to show that nothing is ever perfectly random.
