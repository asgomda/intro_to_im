# Mini PacMan Game

## Game Play and Design
The game manipulates the canvas making use of the translate and rotate functions. The main class is the Pacman class which controls the pacman and there is a food function which controls the food. To play, position the pacman to eat the food. 

The main challenges I faced had to do with the relative positioning of things on the canvas, so I had many iterations of the different parts of the game.   Also, one thing I found out was that, using a global with the rotation angle and setting it as either negative or positive in the rotation function depending on whether it was the top or bottom of the pacman helped avoid having another variable.
